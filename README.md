# Carpoolic

Carpoolic is a ride share application to make carpooling to events easier! Drivers and passengers can use it to create, find, and join rides.

## Instructions:

  * Create an account to join the site.
  * From the banner, you can then create a ride as a driver or go to the ride search page to see available rides that you can join as a passenger.


## Technologies used:

  * HTML, CSS, REACT, and JavaScript
  * The Carpoolic APIs (https://github.com/agraham0925/carpoolic-api)


## The approach taken:

We started planning with our user stories. Once we knew what our user's needed to do, we were able to group the actions to determine what pages we would need and then created our wireframes from there. The pages were then further separated out into React components and we were ready to start coding. We tried to make the components as stand-alone as possible so that they could be reused throughout the site. A good example of where this worked well was the delete and edit buttons for our rides and users.


## Future enhancements:

  * View notifications for cancelled/changed rides
  * Create a ride request as a passenger
  * Search for rides based on selected criteria
  * Use the Google Maps API to get more accurate location data
  * Messaging for people in a ride



## User stories:

* Users should be able to register
* Users should be able to login
* Users should be able to edit their account
* Users should be able to delete their account

* Users should be able to create a ride as a driver
* Users should be able to view rides that they’re a driver for

* Users should be able to see a list of all rides
* Users should be able to add themselves to a ride as a passenger
